# Functional Requirements

---

## Real-world task simulation

The environment must simulate a task humans actually do. Not games, not toys. Examples: email triage, code review, data cleaning, scheduling, customer support, content moderation.

## OpenEnv spec compliance

Implement the full OpenEnv interface: typed Observation, Action, and Reward Pydantic models. step(action) → returns observation, reward, done, info. reset() → returns initial observation. state() → returns current state. openenv.yaml with metadata. Tested via openenv validate.

## Minimum 3 tasks with agent graders

Each task defines a concrete objective an agent must accomplish, with a programmatic grader that scores performance (0.0–1.0). Tasks should range: easy → medium → hard. Graders must have clear, deterministic success/failure criteria.

## Meaningful reward function

Provides signal over the full trajectory (not just binary end-of-episode). Rewards partial progress toward task completion. Penalizes clearly undesirable behavior (e.g. infinite loops, destructive actions).

## Baseline inference script

Uses the OpenAI API client to run a model against the environment. Reads API credentials from environment variables (OPENAI_API_KEY). Produces a reproducible baseline score on all 3 tasks.

# Non-Functional Requirements

## Deploys to a Hugging Face Space

Environment must run as a containerized HF Space tagged with openenv.

## Containerized execution

Must include a working Dockerfile. The environment should start cleanly with docker build + docker run.

## Documentation

README must include: environment description and motivation, action and observation space definitions, task descriptions with expected difficulty, setup and usage instructions, baseline scores.
