| Parameter                     | Weight | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|------------------------------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Real-world utility           | 30%    | Does the environment model a genuine task? Would someone actually use this to train or evaluate agents?                                                                                                    |
| Task & grader quality        | 25%    | Are tasks well-defined with clear objectives? Do graders accurately and fairly measure success? Meaningful difficulty progression?                                                                         |
| Environment design           | 20%    | Clean state management, sensible action/observation spaces, good reward shaping, proper episode boundaries.                                                                                                |
| Code quality & spec compliance | 15%  | Follows OpenEnv spec, clean project structure, typed models, documented, tested, Dockerfile works.                                                                                                         |
| Creativity & novelty         | 10%    | Novel problem domain, interesting mechanics, clever reward design, original approach.                                                                                                                       |

## Scoring Breakdown

### Real-world utility (30%)

- 0–5: Toy/artificial problem with no practical application  
- 6–15: Valid domain but shallow modeling of the real task  
- 16–25: Good domain modeling, would be useful for agent evaluation  
- 26–30: Excellent — fills a real gap, immediate value for the RL/agent community  

### Task & grader quality (25%)

- 3+ tasks with difficulty range?  
- Graders produce scores between 0.0–1.0?  
- Graders deterministic and reproducible?  
- Hard task genuinely challenges frontier models?  

### Environment design (20%)

- reset() produces clean state?  
- Action/observation types well-designed and documented?  
- Reward function provides useful varying signal (not just sparse)?  
- Episode boundaries sensible?  

### Code quality & spec compliance (15%)

- openenv validate passes?  
- docker build && docker run works?  
- HF Space deploys and responds?  
- Baseline script runs and reproduces scores?  

### Creativity & novelty (10%)

- Domain we haven’t seen in OpenEnv before?  
- Reward design has interesting properties?  
- Clever mechanics that make the environment engaging?
